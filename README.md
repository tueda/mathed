Math Editor
===========

Life is akin to an LMS where formulas cannot simply be copied and pasted;
they must be retyped relentlessly each time with a dedicated editor.
Both entail a continuous struggle.
While there is no ultimate solution for life,
we offer a practical solution to ease the struggles within *the LMS*.

The site provides an editor for writing text with LaTeX, which is then
translated into suitable HTML format for pasting into the LMS,
along with a rendering preview of the math using MathJax.
